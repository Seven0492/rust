# Introduction

The key to this exercise are handling basic math operations (Division, addition, etc), and returning their results.

## General guidance

Adding a semi-colon(`;`) at the end of an [expression][expressions-doc-video], changes it to a declaration, or in other words, a statement.

```exercism/note
Statements do not return anything.
```

A question to ask yourself when writting your code:
 - What happens if the input numbers are too big, and the result of their operation [overflows][overflow-doc]?

Questions to ask yourself for further improvements:
 - Is the [standard library][std-lib-doc] really necessary?
 - Am I writting my code in an [idiomatic][idiomatic-rust-doc] way?
